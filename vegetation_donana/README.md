## Background

The workshop uses data from long-term monitoring of shrub abundance and cover in Doñana National Park. The Doñana area is located in southwestern Spain around the Guadalquivir estuary, although the original marshland in the left bank of the river has been totally lost (Fig. 1). Its ecological value has been recognised for centuries, and the Doñana National Park was created in 1969; it was classified as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. The Doñana Natural Area, corresponding to the Biosphere Reserve, includes the National Park, the Natural Park, formed by some peripheral areas of different habitats surrounding the National Park, and areas with lower protection in contact with agricultural areas (Fig. 1). It is considered a Mediterranean-climate region with a subhumid climate characterized by variable rainy seasons historically centred in autumn and spring but shifting towards winter over the last decades, and hot and dry summers. Doñana integrates a large variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, ranging from pine and cork oak forests to shrublands, grasslands, sand dunes, and marshlands with different levels of salinity. This mosaic of habitats is the main reason for its great biodiversity.

## Background

The workshop uses data from long-term monitoring of shrub abundance and cover in Doñana National Park. The Doñana area is located in southwestern Spain around the Guadalquivir estuary, although the original marshland in the left bank of the river has been totally lost (Fig. 1). Its ecological value has been recognised for centuries, and the Doñana National Park was created in 1969; it was classified as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1980 and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. The Doñana Natural Area, corresponding to the Biosphere Reserve, includes the National Park, the Natural Park, formed by some peripheral areas of different habitats surrounding the National Park, and areas with lower protection in contact with agricultural areas (Fig. 1). It is considered a Mediterranean-climate region with a subhumid climate characterized by variable rainy seasons historically centred in autumn and spring but shifting towards winter over the last decades, and hot and dry summers. Doñana integrates a large variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, ranging from pine and cork oak forests to shrublands, grasslands, sand dunes, and marshlands with different levels of salinity. This mosaic of habitats is the main reason for its great biodiversity.

## Biodiversity monitoring

The Biological Research Station, operated by the [ICTS-RBD](https://www.ebd.csic.es/icts-rbd), has been continuously monitoring biodiveristy in Doñana for decades (along with other measurements, such as satellite derived [indices](https://www.ebd.csic.es/servicios/laboratorio-sig-y-teledeteccion)), and has attracted research projects from all over the world. One of these projects is the long-term monitoring of shrubs, which was started by [Paco Lloret](https://www.creaf.cat/en/about-us/our-people/francisco-lloret-maya) (CREAF, Spain) in 2007 after an extreme drought event in the 2005 hydrological year. 

In order to assess community composition before, during, and after the severe drought event, 18 permanent plots of 25 m2 each were established in November 2007 (two years after the drought) on a gradient of drought impact. The plots were located at three sites (with six plots per site): Raposo, Marquas, and Ojillo. To avoid spatial autocorrelation, all plots were separated by at least 50 m from each other. Species plant cover was estimated from contacts with branches along transects within plots; these contacts were divided into two categories corresponding to living or dead canopy. Relative abundance of each species per plot in years after the extreme drought was calculated as the proportion of their contacts of living canopy relative to the sum of the contacts of living canopy of all species. Similarly, the total vegetation cover per plot was calculated as the summed contacts of living canopy of all species.
